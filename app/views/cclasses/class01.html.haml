%p If you want a good place to sit, arrive five minutes early (most students are late due to traffic).

%p
  We teach you JavaScript two different ways.
  
%h1 Lecture + Homework

%p First we offer you a lecture at the beginning of each class.

%p Each lecture should show you how to do some homework.

%p After lecture, you should try the homework covered in lecture.

%p We ask you to try the homework AFTER the lecture, not during the lecture.

%p That is the second way we teach you JavaScript.

%p Review Question: How do we teach you JavaScript?
%p Answer: We teach you JavaScript two ways:
%ul
  %li You watch lecture
  %li You do homework

%p Question: In class do I work on "Lab Exercises"?

%p: Answer: Yes, you work on your homework.
%p So, "Lab Exercises" are the same as Homework.

%p Q: When can I do Homework in class?

%p A: Usually the last 60 Minutes of class is devoted to Homework.

%h1 Laptop?
%p Q: Do I need a laptop for class?
%p A: No, we have class computers for you.
%p Q: Do I need a home-computer for Homework?
%p A: Yes.
%p Q: Should I bring my laptop to class?
%p A: Sure, bring your laptop (but the WIFI is poor).

%p Q: Can you help me setup my laptop to do JavaScript Development?
%p A: I can try, but offer no promises.
%p
  If your laptop is too defective for this class,
  I suggest you buy a new 17 inch HP laptop from costco for $600 and then replace windows with Ubuntu 16.04:

%h1 Class windows-PCs?

%p Q: Are the class windows-PCs good?
%p A: Yes, They have fast CPU, fast SSD drives, and excellent network.
%p I have observed network downloads come in at 70M/sec which is 10x better than my Comcast.

%p Q: Are the class PCs secure?

%p In my opinion windows is not secure.
%p Type no important passwords into class PCs.
%p Do not login to personal e-mail with class PCs.

%p Q: Can I install software inside a VirtualBox running on a class PC?
%p A: Yes.


%h1 Class01 Homework

%p The last 60 minutes of each class is reserved for Homework.

%p At home, you should use your home-computer.
%p To copy homework between home and class, you should use github.com

%p Q: Can I use windows to do JavaScript development?
%ul
  %li A:
  %li You can try; many people do JavaScript development on windows.
  %li But, windows is optimal for developing windows software; not JavaScript software.
  %li If you are new to JavaScript, Linux makes it easier; windows makes it harder.
  %li For JavaScript development, Mac is like Linux but much more expensive.
  %li Mac is useful for developing JavaScript destined for iPhones.

%p Q: After I start the training-env, how to login?
%p
  A: You should see a login screen for an account called: "ann"
  %br/
  The password is: "a"

          mkdir ~/js/
          cd    ~/js/
          git clone https://github.com/danbikle/js410
          cd js410
          \~/heroku/bin/heroku create js410yourname
          git push heroku master
	  
%p Q: How to step through code served by Heroku?
%p A: Study the images and comments below.

%p When you visit your heroku-site with a browser, you should see a blank page.

%p This might confuse you; you might think: "Nothing is there."

%p But, both HTML and JavaScript are there.

%p In my  chrome-browser, I did right-click on the page and then selected Inspect:
%img(src='/class01/db11.png')
%hr/

%p Then I saw some syntax inside that white page:
%img(src='/class01/db13.png')
%hr/

%p I clicked on "Sources" tab near the top:
%img(src='/class01/db15.png')
%hr/

%p I clicked on "index.js" icon near the left:
%img(src='/class01/db17.png')
%hr/

%p I set a "break-point" at line 7; I clicked the round circle in upper left:
%img(src='/class01/db19.png')
%hr/

%p Chrome reloaded the page, started running index.js and stopped at my break-point:
%img(src='/class01/db21.png')
%hr/

%p I used the round-circle on the right to step forward to line 10.
%p After line 10, I used the blue arrow on the right run to the end of the script:
%img(src='/class01/db23.png')
%hr/

%p I clicked the Console tab near the top to look for output from index.js:
%img(src='/class01/db25.png')
%hr/


%p So, that is a quick lesson about how to use the "inspect-feature" inside of chrome.
%p One annoying requirement of browser-JavaScript is that it must be "served" to your browser.

%p If you point your browser at a JavaScript file on your laptop, you cannot run that file.

%p You can, however, see the file. It should look something like this:
%img(src='/class01/file10.png')
%hr/

%p This is inconvenient when you do JavaScript development.

%p A common work-around I use for this problem is to run a small web-server on my laptop.
%p Then, I use that web-server to serve JavaScript files to your browser.

%p Q: How to run a small web-server on my laptop?
%p A: An easy way to do this is to use Node.js
%p I demonstrate shell commands I use to start a Node.js-web-server on my laptop:
